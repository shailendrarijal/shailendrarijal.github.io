                <h1>NAATI CCL Test Format</h1> 
                <p>It is important to understand the test format before you begin your preparation. The Naati CCL test is a 20 minute test. The invigilator will announce the 20 minute time frame reached once you have commenced your test. You, as an interpreter need to interpret the conversation from English to LOTE and LOTE to English. There are two dialogues in your test and each dialogue is broken down into about 10 segments. Each segment is in either English or in LOTE. Your aim is to interpret from one language to another as efficiently as you can so that in a real scenario, you would be able to help two people from different ethnic background understand each other perfectly.</p>

                <h1> What is the format of the test? </h1><p> The test is of 90 marks; 45 marks for each dialogue. To pass the test, you have to get 29 marks out of 45 for each dialogues and in total, you have to get 63 out of 90. The marking is based on oral fluency and your ability to efficiently communicate. You can ask for 1 repitition per dialogue penalty-free. From second repition in a dialogue, you will be penalised. Similarly, you can ask for corrections if you think you have made a mistake. You must pronunce the word "correction" clearly so that the invigilator would hear you. Remember, this is an entirely audio-based test. It is always best to ask for an extra repitition or correction rather than to make mistakes when you know you made a mistake. Keep in mind that repitition means playing the audio again and correction means correcting the words or sentences that you said. The penalty for correction is entirely under the discretion of your examiner.</p>
